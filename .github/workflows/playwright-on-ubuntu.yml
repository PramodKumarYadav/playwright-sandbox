    # After pushing this step to main branch, this step will create a new "gh-pages" named remote branch. 
    # This is the default branch to do github pages deployment of test results.
    # Once this branch is created, 
    #   Go to Project Settings -> then -> Pages -> Build and deployment -> Source -> Select deploy from a branch 
    #   -> Branch select -> gh-pages branch
    # Now, automatically a new deployment with name "pages-build-deployment" will be created and visible under Actions tab.
    # and the pages will be deployed to: https://pramodkumaryadav.github.io/playwright-sandbox/
    # From now on, whenever you push to main branch, the pages will be deployed automatically under above workflow and URL.
    # NOTE: You do NOT need to set the GIT_TOKEN in secrets for this to work. It works out of box automatically.
