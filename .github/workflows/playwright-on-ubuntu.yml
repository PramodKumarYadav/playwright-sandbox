    # After adding this step, the first run will pass but will only create a gh-pages remote branch. 
    # Note that there will be no deployemnt to verify yet at https://pramodkumaryadav.github.io/playwright-sandbox/. 
    # Once you have the gh-pages branch, you need to go to  Project Settings 
    #  then -> Pages -> Build and deployment -> Source -> Select deploy from a branch -> Branch select -> gh-pages branch
    # Now, if there is new run, the pages will be deployed to: https://pramodkumaryadav.github.io/playwright-sandbox/
