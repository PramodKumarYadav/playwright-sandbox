# 🎭 Playwright Sandbox

I have created this repo to both practice playwright and in the process create a template project that can be used by teams to work on real projects for doing end to end test automation. 

## ⚙️ Setup

### Clone Project

Start by cloning the repo on your local machine. 

### Install dependencies

Install project dependencies by running below command:

```bash
npm install
```

## 🔢 Getting Started

### Running tests

Use the [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) to run the tests in the tests folder from VS Code or run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

## 🐞 Playwright Test report 

- Test report in CI is available in the latest workflow run as a URL under `publish-results` step (as shown in below image). You can also refer the latest report from [here](https://pramodkumaryadav.github.io/playwright-sandbox/).
